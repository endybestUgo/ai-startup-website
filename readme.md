# AI Startup Website Project

### Welcome to the collaborative website project for our fictional AI startup! This repository demonstrates how a **Version Control System (VCS)**, specifically **Git**, supports teamwork, ensures safe code collaboration, and prevents overwriting issues during development.

## üß† Objective

### Build a sample website for an AI startup, consisting of several key sections:
- Home
- About Us
- Services
- Contact

Each section is developed by different team members working simultaneously using Git to manage their contributions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Why Version Control?

Without a VCS:
- Multiple developers working on the same file may **overwrite** each other‚Äôs changes.
- It's hard to **track** who made what change and when.
- Reverting to a previous version becomes a manual nightmare.

With Git:
- **Concurrent development** is possible through branching.
- Every change is **tracked** with commit messages.
- Easy to **merge**, **review**, and **roll back** updates.

## üîÅ How the Project Was Set Up

### 1. Initial Setup
- Both Tom and Jerry installed Git.
- They cloned this repository from GitHub to their local machines.
  
### 2. Creating Branches
- Tom created a branch: `update-navigation`
- Jerry created a branch: `add-contact-info`

### 3. Making Changes
- Tom edited `index.html` to update the navigation bar.
- Jerry added contact info to the footer in the same file.

### 4. Commit & Push
- Each developer committed their work to their branch.
- They pushed their branches to the remote repository.

### 5. Pull Request & Merge
- Tom submitted a pull request (PR) first and his branch was merged into `main`.
- Jerry pulled the latest changes, resolved any merge conflicts, then submitted his PR.
- Once reviewed and approved, Jerry‚Äôs changes were merged too.

## ‚úÖ Result

Both developers successfully contributed to the same file (`index.html`) **without overwriting each other‚Äôs work**. Git helped manage the workflow, resolve conflicts, and maintain a clean project history                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             [The repo url](https://github.com/endybestUgo/ai-startup-website.git)
